            "Paste your study notes here: Muscles are specialized soft tissues found in humans and animals, comprising thousands of elastic fibers that enable movement, stability, and crucial bodily functions through contraction. The human body contains over 600 skeletal muscles, which make up roughly 40-50% of total body weight. These tissues operate by pulling on bones, which are connected via tendons, rather than pushing, which is why they frequently work in opposing pairs—such as the biceps contracting to bend the arm while the triceps relaxes, and vice versa. Muscles are primarily categorized into three types: skeletal muscles (voluntary, striated muscles used for movement and posture), cardiac muscles (involuntary, specialized tissue found only in the heart), and smooth muscles (involuntary, non-striated tissues found in walls of organs, blood vessels, and the digestive system). Beyond locomotion, muscles are essential for producing heat—accounting for 85% of body heat production—supporting internal organs, and enabling vital functions like breathing, blood circulation, and digestion.\n",
